Description
You've found the most advanced, most complete, and most intensive masterclass online for learning how to integrate LangChain and ChatGPT into production-ready applications!

Thousands of engineers have learned how to build amazing applications using ChatGPT, and you can too. This course uses a time-tested, battle-proven method to make sure you understand exactly how ChatGPT works, and is the perfect pathway to help you get a new job as a software engineer working on AI-enabled apps.

The difference between this course and all the others: you will go far beyond the basics of simple ChatGPT prompts, and understand how companies are integrating text generation into their apps today.

___________

ChatGPT is being used across industries to enhance applications with text generation. But with this new feature comes many challenges:

Building complex text generation pipelines that incorporate outside information

Creating reusable configuration components that can be reassembled in different ways

Applying user feedback (like upvotes/downvotes) to enhance ChatGPT's output

Wiring in observability and tracing to see how users are interacting with your AI

Generate text performantly using distributed processing

This course will walk you through production-ready, repeatable techniques for addressing each of these challenges and many more.



What will you build?

This course focuses on creating a series of different projects of increasing complexity. You'll start from the very basics, understanding how to access ChatGPT 4 programatically.  From there, we will quickly increase in complexity, building more complex projects with many more features. By the end, you will make a fully-featured web app that implements a "Chat-with-a-PDF" feature. Note: no previous web development experience is required.

Here's a partial list of some of the topics you'll cover:

Understand how complex text-generation pipelines work

Write reusable code using chains provided by LangChain

Connect chains together in different ways to dramatically change your apps behavior with ease

Store, retrieve, and summarize chat messages using conversational memory

Implement semantic search for Retrieval-Augmented Generation using embeddings

Generate and store embeddings in vector databases like ChromaDB and Pinecone

Use retrievers to refine, reduce, and rank context documents, teaching ChatGPT new information

Create agents to automatically accomplish tasks for you using goals you define

Write tools and plugins to allow ChatGPT to access the outside world

Maintain a consistent focus on performance through distributed processing using Celery and Redis

Extend LangChain to implement server-to-browser text streaming

Improve ChatGPT's output quality through user-generated feedback mechanisms

Get visibility into how users interact with your text generation features by using tracing

There are a ton of courses that show how to use ChatGPT at a very basic level. This is one of the very few courses online that goes far beyond the basics to teach you advanced techniques that top companies are using today. I have a passion for teaching topics the right way - the way that you'll actually use technology in the real world. Sign up today and join me!
